* [PSR-4: Autoloader](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)

See the [PSR-FIG website](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) for more information.

## Version number
The version numbers follow the [semantic versioning 2.0](http://semver.org/)

## Testing

Each new pull request have to contain the corresponding unit testing (if necessary).

## Workflow

We follow the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as working model with git.
Any modification have to go through a Pull Request on Github.

# Report an issue or proposing modifications:
